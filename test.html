        Hi my name is <span>rashik</span>. I am 21 years old.
        I like to play pool. I am trying to overcome my 
        bad-habit of procrastination and negative thinking.
        To do so I am trying to be consistent at things in my
        life which gets me closer to the kind of person I want
        to become. I am also currently reading a book called
        'Atomic Habits' which is written by James Clear. Its an
        amazing book and I love every line of it. It helps
        me look at my life and its problems from a different
        perspective which has been helping me out a lot lately.
